### 1. Define the System Components:
Understand the main components of the system, both front-end and back-end.

#### Front-End:
- User Interface (UI): Sketch out the main pages and user flows. Use a tool like Figma or Sketch to create wireframes or prototypes.

Going to use react.js as the webframe work
- Interaction with Back-End: Determine how the front-end will communicate with the back-end, often through APIs.

#### Back-End:
- Web Framework: As you're using Flask, identify the main routes and controllers.
- Models: Identify the core logic and algorithms, such as stock prediction models.
- Database: Sketch the schema for MySQL, identifying tables, relationships, and indexes.
- APIs: Design the API endpoints that the front-end will consume.

### 2. Consider Scalability:
Think about how the system may need to scale in the future.
- Can you easily add new prediction models?
- Will the database handle the expected load?
- Are there any potential bottlenecks?

### 3. Security and Compliance:
Address any security concerns, such as user authentication and data protection.

### 4. Integration:
- How will the front-end and back-end interact? Usually, through RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
- Consider any third-party services or tools you might need.

### 5. Deployment:
- Choose a hosting platform that fits your needs.
- Consider how you'll manage updates and rollbacks.

### 6. Draw a Diagram:
Visualizing the architecture can be very helpful. Tools like Lucidchart or draw.io allow you to create architecture diagrams that illustrate how the different components interact.

### Example Diagram:
1. **Front-End:** Browsers communicate with the Flask back-end through HTTP/HTTPS.
2. **Back-End:** Flask handles requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the database.
3. **Database:** MySQL stores data related to stock predictions, models, etc.
4. **External Services:** If any, such as stock data providers.

### 7. Review and Iterate:
Review the architecture with stakeholders (if any), such as team members or mentors. Iterate on the design as needed, considering feedback, constraints, and new insights.
