# Project Frontend Design

In this section, we will define the components and design considerations for the frontend of the stock price prediction web application using React.js as the web framework.

## 1. Define the System Components:

### Front-End:
- User Interface (UI): The frontend will include various pages for users to interact with the application. We will create wireframes and prototypes using tools like Figma or Sketch to visualize the main pages and user flows.

- Interaction with Back-End: The frontend will communicate with the backend through RESTful APIs. It will send HTTP requests to the backend to fetch data, such as stock prices and predictions, and display the results to users.

## 2. Consider Scalability:

To ensure the frontend can scale in the future, we will address the following points:
- Modular Code: Write modular and reusable components to easily add new features or pages to the application.
- Efficient Data Handling: Implement data caching and pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Code Splitting: Utilize code splitting to optimize the loading time of the application and improve user experience.

## 3. Security and Compliance:

To address security concerns, we will implement the following measures:
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.
- Data Protection: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission between the frontend and backend.
- Input Validation: Apply strict input validation on user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

## 4. Integration:

The frontend will interact with the backend through RESTful APIs. Additionally, we may integrate third-party services for stock data, such as stock data providers, to fetch real-time stock prices.

## 5. Deployment:

For deployment, we will choose a hosting platform that meets our requirements, such as Heroku or AWS. We will ensure smooth deployment processes and have strategies in place for handling updates and rollbacks.

## 6. Draw a Diagram:

Visualizing the frontend architecture can help understand how different components interact. Here's a simple example diagram:

1. **Front-End:** Browsers communicate with the Flask backend through HTTP/HTTPS, sending requests for stock data and predictions.
2. **Back-End:** Flask handles requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the MySQL database to fetch data.
3. **Database:** MySQL stores data related to stock predictions, models, and user information.
4. **External Services:** If any, such as third-party stock data providers.

## 7. Review and Iterate:

We will regularly review the frontend architecture with stakeholders, such as team members and mentors, and iterate on the design as needed. This iterative process will help us refine the frontend design, considering feedback, constraints, and new insights to ensure a robust and user-friendly application.
