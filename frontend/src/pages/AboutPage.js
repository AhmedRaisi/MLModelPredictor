      <section className="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our stock price prediction process involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Data Collection: We gather historical stock price data from reliable sources.</li>
          <li>Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.</li>
          <li>Model Training: We train our machine learning models on the training data to learn patterns and relationships.</li>
          <li>Prediction Generation: Using the trained models, we make predictions on the testing data.</li>
          <li>Evaluation: The predictions are evaluated using various metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).</li>
          <li>Real-Time Predictions: Our models can also generate real-time predictions for live stock data.</li>
        </ol>
