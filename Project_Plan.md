# Project Planning

## 1. Define the Project Scope and Objectives

### What are the main goals of the application?
Main goal of the application is to:
- Display different Models used for stock prediction
- Display accuracy and MSE for each
- Have an overview page comparing each
- Creating the best predictor possible

### What features and functionalities are required?
- Page for each model and review  
- Page for overview and comparing
- Page for best model

### Who is the target audience?
- Personal project possibly some employers.

## 2. Analyze and Understand the Requirements
- Break down the features into detailed requirements.
  - Have a page for each model and review
  - Have a page for overview and comparing each model
  - Have a page for the best model
  - Each page has a description and reasoning for why its bad or good
- Consider user needs, business logic, and technical constraints. (TBD)
- Document everything clearly for future reference.

## 3. Choose the Right Technology Stack
- **Front end**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Chart.js
- **Back end**: Python, Flask for web framework, MySQL for databases
- Consider the scalability, maintainability, and community support of each technology.
  - Few base databases will be set; automatic updating databases could be added in the future
  - More models can be added as time goes

## 4. Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
  - **Project Planning**
    1. Define Scope and Objectives
    2. Analyze and Understand Requirements
    3. Choose Technology Stack
    4. Design Architecture
    5. Develop Timeline and Budget
    6. Plan for Testing and Deployment
    7. Address Legal and Compliance
    8. Risk Management Plan
    9. Collaboration and Communication
    10. Documentation
  - **Front-End Development**
    1. Design UI/UX
       - Sketch Layout
       - Design Pages
       - Implement Charting (e.g., Chart.js)
    2. Develop Pages
       - Model Review Pages
       - Overview Page
       - Best Model Page
    3. Testing and Quality Assurance
  - **Back-End Development**
    1. Set Up Development Environment
    2. Implement Web Framework (Flask)
    3. Database Design and Implementation (MySQL)
    4. Develop APIs
       - Implement Model Logic
       - Implement Comparison Logic
    5. Integration with Front-End
    6. Testing and Quality Assurance
  - **Deployment**
    1. Select Hosting Platform
    2. Prepare for Deployment
    3. Deploy Application
    4. Monitor and Maintain
  - **Documentation and Reporting**
    1. Document Code
    2. Create User Guide
    3. Prepare Final Report
- Estimate the time and resources needed for each task.
- Identify dependencies between tasks and potential bottlenecks.

## 5. Design the Architecture
- Outline the architecture of the back-end (e.g., database schema, API design).
- Sketch the user interface, considering user experience (UX) principles.
- Plan how the front-end and back-end will interact.

## 6. Develop a Timeline and Budget
- Create a realistic timeline for the project, considering all tasks and dependencies.
- Budget for any costs, such as hosting, third-party services, or licenses.

## 7. Plan for Testing and Deployment
- Decide on testing methodologies and tools.
- Plan how and where the application will be deployed.

## 8. Consider Legal and Compliance Issues
- Address any legal requirements, such as privacy policies or data protection regulations.

## 9. Create a Risk Management Plan
- Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.

## 10. Collaborate and Communicate
- If working with a team, establish clear roles and responsibilities.
- Set up regular communication channels to ensure everyone stays aligned.

## 11. Documentation
- Maintain detailed documentation of everything planned.
- Consider creating a project wiki or similar resource that all team members can access.
