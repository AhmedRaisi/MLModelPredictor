# Project Planning

## 1. Define the Project Scope and Objectives

### What are the main goals of the application?
Main goal of the application is to:
- Display different Models used for stock prediction
- Display accuracy and MSE for each
- Have an overview page comparing each
- Creating the best predictor possible

### What features and functionalities are required?
- Page for each model and review  
- Page for overview and comparing
- Page for best model

### Who is the target audience?
- Personal project possibly some employers.

## 2. Analyze and Understand the Requirements
- Break down the features into detailed requirements.
  - Have a page for each model and review
  - Have a page for overview and comparing each model
  - Have a page for the best model
  - Each page has a description and reasoning for why its bad or good
- Consider user needs, business logic, and technical constraints. (TBD)
- Document everything clearly for future reference.

## 3. Choose the Right Technology Stack
- **Front end**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Chart.js
- **Back end**: Python, Flask for web framework, MySQL for databases
- Consider the scalability, maintainability, and community support of each technology.
  - Few base databases will be set; automatic updating databases could be added in the future
  - More models can be added as time goes

## 4. Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.

    5.3 Prepare Final Report
    - Estimate the time and resources needed for each task.
    - Identify dependencies between tasks and potential bottlenecks.

## 5. Design the Architecture
- Outline the architecture of the back-end (e.g., database schema, API design).
- Sketch the user interface, considering user experience (UX) principles.
- Plan how the front-end and back-end will interact.

## 6. Develop a Timeline and Budget
- Create a realistic timeline for the project, considering all tasks and dependencies.
- Budget for any costs, such as hosting, third-party services, or licenses.

## 7. Plan for Testing and Deployment
- Decide on testing methodologies and tools.
- Plan how and where the application will be deployed.

## 8. Consider Legal and Compliance Issues
- Address any legal requirements, such as privacy policies or data protection regulations.

## 9. Create a Risk Management Plan
- Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.

## 10. Collaborate and Communicate
- If working with a team, establish clear roles and responsibilities.
- Set up regular communication channels to ensure everyone stays aligned.

## 11. Documentation
- Maintain detailed documentation of everything planned.
- Consider creating a project wiki or similar resource that all team members can access.
