# MLStockPredictors

MLStockPredictors is a web application that features various prediction models for stocks and compares their performance. This project aims to provide users with insights into different machine learning models and their abilities to forecast stock prices. Users can explore and visualize the predictions made by these models to gain a better understanding of their effectiveness in the stock market.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Data Visualization: Recharts
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Styling: CSS

## Features

### Home Page

The home page welcomes users and provides an overview of the MLStockPredictors application. It showcases various sections:

- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing section with a call-to-action button to explore the available models.
- **Features Overview**: An overview of the key features and functionalities of the application.
- **Model Showcase**: A section that displays a chart representing the performance of various prediction models.
- **How It Works**: An explanation of the working principles of the prediction models used in the application.
- **Success Stories**: A section highlighting success stories and real-world applications of MLStockPredictors.
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions and answers for users' reference.

### Model Pages

The application includes dedicated pages for each prediction model, providing in-depth information about the specific model. Each model page follows the same layout, featuring:

- **Model Title**: The title of the prediction model.
- **Description**: A detailed description of the model, including its functioning and underlying principles.
- **Usage**: Information on how users can effectively utilize the model for forecasting stock prices.
- **Performance Graph**: A graphical representation of the model's predictions compared to actual stock prices.
- **Error Metrics**: Evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error, to assess model performance.
- **Conclusion**: A conclusion summarizing the model's strengths and potential areas for improvement.

### ML Algorithms

The machine learning algorithms used for stock price prediction can be found in the backend of the application. TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are utilized to build and train the predictive models. The trained models' predictions are then made accessible to the frontend, where they are visualized and presented to the users.

### Data Visualization

MLStockPredictors leverages Recharts, a data visualization library, to create interactive and insightful charts that showcase the performance of prediction models.
